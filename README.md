## üîç Overview

SentiTransformer is a PyTorch implementation of a transformer model built from scratch for sentiment analysis. The project includes:

- Complete transformer architecture with self-attention mechanisms
- Sentiment analysis classification head
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Inference functionality for new text

This implementation is designed to be educational and modifiable, allowing users to understand the inner workings of transformer models while applying them to a practical NLP task.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The model architecture follows the original "Attention is All You Need" paper with modifications specific to sentiment analysis:
